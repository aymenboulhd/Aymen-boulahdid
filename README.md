# Aymen-boulahdid
 First of all, I introduce myself to you. I am Ayman Boulahdid, a software developer, a mobile application developer, and a logo designer on Photoshop. I have a modest career so far. I have three years of experience in developing programs of all kinds, and I work on Python, Java, and flutter in particular and with a necessary professionalism. As for the design of logos, I do not have a long time in this field (about a year). As for the method of work, I like to give extra importance to the customer so that I provide him with quality, accuracy, and timely delivery of work, as well as after-sales services.
